**Rogue Robs Banks** is 7DRL 2020 entry, based on my previous game, [Rogue Robs Trains](https://github.com/VedVid/RogueRobsTrains).

Topics: western, Old West, good old bank robbing.

RRB is developed with my own [RAWIG](https://github.com/VedVid/RAWIG) roguelike template, [BearLibTerminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal) library made by Cfyz, and [Deferral-Square](https://github.com/brianbruggeman/Deferral) font made by Brian Bruggeman.
